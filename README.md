**Simulations**  
We have included the scripts used for calculating numerical solutions on a high-performance computing system. Note that you may need to modify the syntax and install packages depending on the particular HPC that you are using. These data were generated on the <a href='https://oarc.rutgers.edu/resources/amarel/'>Rutgers Amarel cluster </a>.
